# Web-Driver-Toolkit
A small python script for downloading NVIDIA Web Drivers based on either the current OS build version - or a selected build version.

Can also patch the currently installed web drivers, as well as web driver install packages.

To install, do the following one line at a time in Terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/corpnewt/Web-Driver-Toolkit
    cd Web-Driver-Toolkit
    chmod +x Run.command
    
Then run with either `./Run.command` or by double-clicking *Run.command*
